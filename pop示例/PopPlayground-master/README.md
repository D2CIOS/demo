PopPlayground
=============

Examples and Controls made entirely using [Pop new Facebook's animation framework](https://github.com/facebook/pop)

This project includes 3 different tabs:
* Basic concepts: comparison between iOS animations and new Pop's animations.
* Examples: Some examples animating many different properties using Pop
* Controls: two UIControls made entirely using Pop. The controls are unfinished (no callback functions, completion blocks, etc.), just animations
